# Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence
## Solved by Daniel Montilla using python3

# Problem
You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters. Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
