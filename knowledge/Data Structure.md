A data structure is a way of organizing, storing and managing data in such a manner as to enable efficient access, modification and other operations of said data.

## Primitive Data Structures
There are the fundamental building blocks of data and can't be broken down into other data structures. These includes integers, floats and booleans.

## Non-Primitive Data Structures
These can be broken down into other data structures such as [[Array|Arrays]], [[Tree|Trees]] and [[Linked List|Linked Lists]].
